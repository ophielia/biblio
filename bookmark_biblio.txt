** MASTER **
complete - use case 1 - setup project
done - need client table, repository, as well as selectkey and value
done - setup git, checkin
done - add values to selectkey and value - type, status, detail status
done - change type, status, language and detail status in book to long

----- end complete history ----

******* LATER DEVPT ******

bookstatus - processing - after book bought, but before it's shelved (waiting for cover, for example).  Screen to enter when shelved??
not now - usecase 16.5 findOrCreateArtist - to reuse names in db
not now - usecase 16.5 artist name handling in general not done - needs handling in CS
puzzle - how to insert a validator into controller test - basically, just do a different test to test Validator.  Stand alone test.
createCatalogEntryFromBookModel - graceful handling of exception calling google books api
assignBookDetails - graceful handling of exception

******* NOTES ******

1. Testing filling in books after import of details... Separate Google calls into their own
   service, which then can be mocked - and isolated for the test.

******* USE CASE MASTER ******
